This example demonstrates a common pitfall in Elixir when attempting to modify a list while iterating over it with `Enum.each`.  The code intends to remove the element `3` from the list, but due to Elixir's immutable nature, the `List.delete` function creates a *new* list, leaving the original list unaffected by the iteration. The `IO.inspect` shows that the original list is unchanged.
